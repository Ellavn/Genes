Constraints
===========
Undering our making,the web application will use for biologists all around the world,so we need to take some main constraints into account so that we can come up any useful ideas to deal.Because only in this way can people use it smoothly.


Browser Compatibility
---------------------
Browser function can not be used,site dislocation,site some content does not show ,site effect do not show.Either way,incompatibilities can create a very unfriendly user experience for visitors.And what we are trying to do this,no matter what browser a user USES to view our website or log into our system,we are able to provide a consistent display.Thus the application should be **accessible through Firefox, Chrome, and Safari**.


Trade space for time
--------------------
When you think about algorithms in general,you are talking adout time complexity.In fact,memory is now a much cheaper computing resource than it used to be.So a commmon startegy is to trade space for time.So I cache the intermediate results of more program runs in memory,which is definitely more efficiently than reading from a file the next time it is written.


Budget
------
Budget less than 10,000 USD.

 
System Downtime
---------------
System **downtime less than 60 minutes per year** in order to satisfy users'large demand of data analyzing.
